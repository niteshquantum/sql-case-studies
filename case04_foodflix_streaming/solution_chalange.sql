--Challenge ï¿½ Payments Table for Foodflix (2020)

--The Foodflix   team would like you to generate a payments table for the year 2020 that reflects actual payment activity. The logic should include:

--* Monthly payments are charged on the same day of the month as the start date of the plan.
--* Upgrades from Basic to Pro plans are charged immediately, with the upgrade cost reduced by the amount already paid in that month.
--* Upgrades from Pro Monthly to Pro Annual are charged at the end of the current monthly billing cycle, and the new plan starts at the end of that cycle.
--* Once a customer churns, no further payments are made.

--Example output rows for the payments table could include:
--("customer_id", "plan_id", "plan_name", "payment_date", "amount", "payment_order")
